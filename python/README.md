- I separated Python code into pure notebooks and scripts because didactically notebooks are better for learning. It was with them that I created most of the codes present here.

- Github sometimes has some problems rendering notebooks, so I strongly recommend using a tool like Google Colab or Jupyter Notebook to open them.
