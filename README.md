# Challenges and Studies

- In this repository are all the codes I've used in college courses since I started the Biomedical Informatics course in 2017. This was also the year I started learning programming, so here we have all my initial foundations.

- It is important to remember that issues such as clean code, programming logic, concept separation, flexibility, scalability and performance were not applied, as most are exercises.

- Although they are exercises, they can still be very useful if you are wanting to learn, I hope I can help in some way!
